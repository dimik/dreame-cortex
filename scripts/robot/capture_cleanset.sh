# capture_cleanset.sh — Phase-1 capture harness for the MCU CLEANSET fan-byte filter.
#
# Deploys the LOG-mode shim onto AVA, drives the robot through known fan states, and pulls
# the captured 55 AA frames for offline decode. The decoded frames feed the FRAME SPEC
# constants in fanoff_shim.c (CLEANSET_CMD, FAN_OFFSET, checksum). See CLAUDE.md.
#
# PREREQUISITES (run first):
#   1. scp scripts/robot/fanoff_shim.c build_fanoff.sh   dreame-home:/data/
#   2. ssh dreame-home 'sh /data/build_fanoff.sh'        # builds /data/lib/libfanoff_log.so
#   3. Patched ava.sh in place exporting LD_PRELOAD=/data/lib/libfanoff_log.so (see NOTE).
#
# NOTE on injection: AVA is launched by /etc/rc.d/ava.sh (squashfs). To preload the LOG shim
# for a capture WITHOUT a reboot, restart AVA manually with the env set:
#     killall -9 ava
#     cd /data && LD_PRELOAD=/data/lib/libfanoff_log.so ava -f /ava/conf/r2250.conf force &
# (For the production FILTER shim we instead bind-mount a patched ava.sh at boot — see
#  deploy_fanoff.sh — so the watchdog's restarts also get the preload.)
#
# !! REQUIRES A HUMAN: you must listen and confirm fan ON/OFF at each step, and ideally set
#    each fan-speed preset so each speed maps to a distinct byte value. Robot stays docked
#    /stationary throughout (manual-control enable spins the fan with spdv=0).
#
# Usage: sh capture_cleanset.sh   (run ON the robot, or via ssh dreame-home 'sh -s' < this)
