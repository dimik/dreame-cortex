# deploy_ava_shims.sh — install the AVA LD_PRELOAD shims live (without a reboot).
#
# MECHANISM (shared by every shim, feature-agnostic): AVA is launched by /etc/rc.d/ava.sh
# (squashfs, read-only) and restarted by the watchdog (exec_monitor/monitor.sh). To make EVERY
# launch preload our shims, we bind-mount a patched copy of ava.sh that exports LD_PRELOAD
# before exec'ing ava. Same squashfs-override trick as the wpa_supplicant.conf bind-mount.
#
# This is the same patch _root.sh applies at early boot (for reboot persistence). This script
# does it live AND restarts AVA so you can test immediately. Keep the LD_PRELOAD list here in
# sync with _root.sh.
#
# SHIMS (independent features; each loaded only if its .so is present):
#   libfanoff_filter.so  — fan/LiDAR quieting   (build: build_ava_shims.sh)
#   libcamsiphon.so      — read-only camera tap  (build: build_ava_shims.sh)
#   libldstap.so         — read-only LiDAR ttyS3 tap -> /scan (build: build_ava_shims.sh)

# Run ON the robot:  sh /data/deploy_ava_shims.sh
